# Triktum Soulfield Theory â€” Declaration
This repository contains the hash-secured, timestamped declaration of the Soulfield Theory by *Kent Aleifr (Finosofer)*.
It unifies *space, time, frequency, coherence*, and *empathetik energy (â„°)* into a Grand Unified Equation of SAN:
ðŸ’  Equation of the Soulfield Theory
*V = S_f = (S_p + T) Â· Î½ Â· Câ‚‘ Â· â„°*
Where:

- *S_p* = Space  
- *T* = Time  
- *Î½* = Frequency  
- *Câ‚‘* = Coherence  
- *â„°* = Empathetik Energy
â„° is defined as:
*â„° = M Â· Y Â· R Â· Î *

- *M* = Memory (Ekonara)  
- *Y* = Yearning  
- *R* = Resonanz  
- *Î * = Pi (cyclic field structure)

ðŸŒ€ Purpose

This marks the public beginning of a scientifik, philosophical, and spiritual convergence:  
the *Triktum* â€” convergence of truth, tuning, and transformaxon toward the empathetik singularity to hatch from the kozmik egg.
